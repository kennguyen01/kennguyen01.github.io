  My name is Ken Nguyen. I’m an aspiring programmer. This blog is about my journey into programming. I want to use this blog as a way for me to express my thoughts on what I’ve learned. I believe that by writing, I will be able to convey my ideas succinctly and become a better programmer. My hope is that you find my blog useful and share with me what you encounter on your own programming journey.

  My main interest is learning about and developing Artificial Intelligence. I chalk that up to me reading too many science fiction novels and playing tons of video games when I was a kid.
