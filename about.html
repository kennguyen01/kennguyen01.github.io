<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Ken Nguyen. This blog is about my journey into programming. It's is a way for me to express my thoughts on topics related to programming and things I find interesting. I believe that by writing, I will be able to convey my ideas succinctly and become a better programmer.

  This blog is also a good way for me to document what I learned and the projects I completed. I find that sourcing content on the internet can be challenging with the massive amount of information out there. When I have a topic I want to jump quickly into, I try to write a post about it so I can reference the material later. If you think my posts are helpful or interesting, feel free to leave me a comment or email me.
