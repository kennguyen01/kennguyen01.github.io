<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Ken Nguyen. I'm an aspiring programmer. This blog is about my journey into programming and web development. I want to use this blog as a way for me to express my thoughts on programming. I believe that by writing, I will be able to convey my ideas succinctly and become a better programmer. My hope is that you find my blog useful.

  My main interest is learning more about web development and developing elegant web applications.
