title: Tracking My Working Hours

I tried out a few Pomodoro apps when I study or do work to stop myself from checking the phone. Most of them are quite similar and offer the same functionalities. But the one I use the most is [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/). It's the most charming Pomodoro that I keep coming back to. The $1.99 I paid for the app has paid for itself many times over in term of my productivity gain. The interface is clean and simple. I can also tag what the time is being used to do and it breaks down those hours for me in nice graphs.

## An Intuitive Interface

Some apps have a lot of things going on in the interface. Sometimes there's a mini Kanban board going on and for each task, I need to assign how much time I want to dedicate to it. I think that's an overkill. If I want to use an actual Kanban, I rather just use a website that offers more functionalities as I'm working. For my Pomodoro, I prefer something that's intuitive and easy to use. I'm currently using Forest app as I'm writing this post. It's a bit of cheating for me to take a screenshot but it's for the purpose of demonstration.
