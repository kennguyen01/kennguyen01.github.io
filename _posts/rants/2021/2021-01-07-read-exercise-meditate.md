In 2020, time passed slowly for me because I stayed indoor most of the time. Every time I followed the news, constant barrage of sensational stories overwhelmed me. I watched the riot at the Capitol Building with dread and uncertainty yesterday because I live 30 minutes away from where it happened. With so many things going on around the U.S., I decided that it's much better for me to focus on my well-being rather than following current events.

I experimented with different methods to stay physically and emotionally healthy last year. Sleep is non-negotiable for me so I looked into what I could do in my waking hours. I found that these three activities helped me to be most productive: read, exercise, and meditate. I created a simple system that includes those activities to my daily schedule.

## Read

The internet has an abundant of articles on every topic imaginable. The drawback is the abundant of links being included in those articles. I often fall into a rabbit hole when I read an interesting article. I will follow the links to see what else is available. At the end of the surfing session, I only come out with a general idea of what I started with.

I want to eliminate the fragmented mindset of reading internet articles. When I read something online, I want to jump to the next topic without digesting what I just read. My attention span is much shorter now as a result. To change that, I made a list of different topics I want to learn more about and purchased books related to those topics.

I transferred those books to my Kindle and committed at least one hour to read everyday. When I read, I disconnect from the internet completely. I read slower now as I attempt to understand what is being written. I play with the ideas in my mind, combine them with past knkowledge, and form something different. The process is laborious but enjoyable.

## Exercise

Sitting all day is terrible for my back and neck. While I try to keep a good posture, I still feel uncomfortable after long periods of sitting. The effects are accumulating on my body so I practice yoga recently to counteract those effects. I tried weight lifting and running before but those exercises did not address my problems.

My flexibility improved immensely since I started. My back and neck pain were reduced to almost nothing. It's the most effective exercise I found for my needs.

## Meditate

Meditation is difficult. The constant bombardments of thoughts about everything make my emotional state a swirling mess. I started with ten minutes of meditation in the morning. It was a humbling experience. My mind was a racing horse that kept on running at full speed. I held on to the reins for dear life.

The experience was agonizing. I thought I did not set my alarm because it has already been so long. I opened my eyes and it was barely five minutes. Then I stopped fighting with the horse. I let it go wherever it wanted to. I sit back and observe the scenery of thoughts passing by. When I pay too much attention to a thought, the horse gallops full speed again to chase it. It's a learning process of observing but not engaging.

Similar to exercise, meditation was uncomfortable at first but I felt great afterward. I am able to control my emotions better. It forms a filter around my mind. When negative emotions spring up, I learn to recognize them with the filter and let them pass. I judge myself less harshly when I make mistakes.

## REM

A nice addition to my three activities is that they form the acronym REM. The REM sleep rejuvenates my brain while my awake REM improves my personal well-being. The activities take time but my productivity decline when I don't perform maintenance on myself.
