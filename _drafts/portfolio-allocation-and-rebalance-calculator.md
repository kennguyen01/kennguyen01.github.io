Every month, I hop on to Vanguard to take a look at my Roth IRA account. Since I don't have automatic investing set up, I manually contribute to my IRA and allocate the money to the specific ETFs that I own. The contribution limit for 2019 was $6,000 so every month I would contribute $500. While manual contribution seems like additional work compared to using a target date fund, it offers me two advantages: lower fees and allocation freedom. The tradeoff is that I need to spend around ten minutes every month crunching the numbers for the allocation. To make the process less tedious, I wrote a simple portfolio rebalance calculator for that. In this post, I'll talk about the rationale behind choosing to do my own allocation and the calculator.
