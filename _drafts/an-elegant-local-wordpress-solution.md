If someone who knows nothing about making websites asked me how they can make one, my answer has always been the same: WordPress. While that seems like the obvious, it's really the best option for them. I've been using WordPress way before I learned to write my first line of code. While it has a learning curve if you've never used it before, there are plenty of resources available to help you out. If those resources cannot solve your problems, there are many people who develop and use WordPress that can answer your questions.

But this post is not about using WordPress itself. There are many good resources for that and I defer to them. This post is about setting up a local WordPress environment on your computer. If you work with WordPress enough, you will eventually need this feature. Back then, I made the mistake of changing my first blog directly while it was live. I thought that just changing the theme wouldn't be so bad. It broke my site so badly that I spent hours getting everything to display properly again. I know better now. I always make changes in a local environment first.

## Local by Flywheel

If you still haven't looked up that name, do it now. Better yet, let me give you the [link](https://localbyflywheel.com/). This is hands down the best WordPress development I've ever used. I used it when it first came out and I fell in love with this product ever since. You don't need to know any knowledge of coding or setting up a virtual environment. You click a few buttons and you are ready to develop your site locally.

If you're ahead of me and have been looking at other options for local WordPress, you probably seen some acronyms like XAMPP or MAMP. With Local, you don't need to know what any of them mean. Learning to set up those environment takes time and effort. You are prone to break something and it can be a hassle to fix those issues. You want to start designing your site right away instead of tinkering with different customization for those environments. 

So why am I bringing this up now? It's because Flywheel just recently released Local for Linux. 

My main computer is running Ubuntu now so I haven't used Local at all since I switched over. But the good folks at Flywheel listened to their community and worked on a couple of versions for Linux distributions. I could not be happier when I found out about the news. 

I won't write a short guide to setting up Local because everything is intuitive. It gives you the necessary controls and takes care of the niggling implementation details. Try it and you will wonder where has it been all your life.
